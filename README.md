# Horrible

The crazy chat app

**Horrible** is an app where you get to talk with your friends live... like in real life. There's no history of previous messages. You see what they have to say _right now_.

## Why?

I came up with this **horrible** idea not for this app to be successful.  
It's not for users. It's for me. So I can learn.  
This is a side project for me to learn. Becuase I learn... by doing.

PS: I did try a regular chat app. But I just tend to lose motivation to build _just another chat app_.
This **horrible** idea ensured I stayed motivated because I was doing something unique ðŸ˜‹.
